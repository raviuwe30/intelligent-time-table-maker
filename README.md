The manual timetable scheduling demands considerable time and efforts along with lots of paperwork. The timetable scheduling can also be considered as a Constraint satisfaction problem (CSP), which is a unique concept in Artificial Intelligence, in which we find a solution that satisfies the given set of constraints. Time table scheduling has been in human requirements since they thought of managing time effectively It is widely used in schools, colleges and other fields of teaching. In early days, time table scheduling was done manually with a single person or some group involved in task of scheduling it with their hands, which take lot of effort and time. While scheduling, even the smallest constraints can take a lot of time and the case is even worse when the number of constraints or the amount of data to deal with increases. Other cases that can cause   problem is when the number of Faculties (Teaching Staff) are less, resulting in rescheduling of time table or they need to fill on empty seats urgently. In such cases automated timetable, scheduling can be a very convenient method for managing it in computers with algorithms also proving to be eco-friendly for no paperwork.
